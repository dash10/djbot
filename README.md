Supybot plugin to control Pianobar via IRC

### IMPORTANT ###
This is still a work in progress!

### Useage ###
play loads Pianobar and starts playing

stop stops playback and unloads Pianobar

etc.

### Setup ###
I will assume that you are familiar with Limnoria / Supybot if you are setting up this plugin.

It requires a standard installation of Pianobar.

If you are running a Raspberry Pi (as I am) you will likely need to use Pianobar 2013.05.19

Make sure default controls and your Pandora account credentials are set in the config file.

Test Pianobar to ensure it will start playing on load, currently DjBot doesn't have the ability to login or select station on start.
